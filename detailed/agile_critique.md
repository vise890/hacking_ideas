# Retros

## Actions
We change stuff. We decide what we’re gonna do from now on.
- How do we know if what we’re doing is actually improving our work
  or if it is just adding more overhead?
  - Humans are not goood judges of the effect of measures on productivity/velocity
    (cit needed, look for the “observer” effect)

## Worth
- Retros are *really long*. Are they worth it at all?
- the positive things are never discussed.
    - effort is wasted putting them down and esp. grouping them
    - could there be more effective outlets for celebrating success?
      - do we celebrate it too much already?...

## Solutions
- Would it be beneficial to  have a trello board for the feedback-like stuff?
- should we limit the # if stuckies that each person can put up?

# Meetings
- I find it really hard to stay focussed
- I don’t find it useful to have any sort of meeting/huddle/standup.
- My concerns:
  - they break concentration/streaks . they interrupt!
    - i’m still thinking about the problem i’m solving, esp. in the
      afternoon ones 
  - they are (mostly) irrelevant to me/others
  - they are and inefficient and ephimearal way to convey information

## Solutions
Is there a better way?
- the general standup first thing at springer seemed good..
=> Does anyone have anything to say that the *whole group* needs to hear?


# MVC / java / .net / enterprise code
- verbose
- tons of files
- tons of (slow, repetitive, unreadable, flaky) tests
- tons of junk
