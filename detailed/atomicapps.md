# Atomic Apps

AtomicApps is a set of applications that do just one little thing. They are as simple as possible, they are atomic.

AtomicApps live in the cloud, they are extremely lightweight and they are easily connected to each other. Their interface is uncluttered and they can run full screen. The are also free (as in speech).

The main interface to launch AA is an alfred like launch bar. It can search files, the web (+google services) and launch apps.

AA share one filetype only: simple text. AA editors exist to open and edit simple text for different purposes. Some of the examples include:
	- php
	- css
	- md
	- blog
	- pocket
	- bookmark manager (delicious)
	- diary
	- journal
	- movie collection
	- task editor (GTD, todo, taskpaper)

Each file "type" is just a defined, open XML standard. Or any other language (like MD)

AA can be themed with CSS. They use conventions so that CSS style sheets can be created and used by the community.
