# Citation db for scientific publishing

Writing in markdown is nice. Citing works in is not. It is even more awful in
bibtex.


## API for citations/refs

Citedb should have a badass and stupidly simple API:

```
GET /book/MLA/sust2011hendley
PATCH /book/MLA/sust2011hendley
...

GET /journal/... etc.
```
