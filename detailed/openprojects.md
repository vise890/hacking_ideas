# OpenProjects

OpenProjecs is a platform to make people work on problems they are pasisonate about. 

Let's say I am a fourth year architectural engineerign student (like I am supposed to be). If I specified my interests as tags (low energy building design, engineering, international development, travel, india), if problems were tagged and if I could search a database of projects that are really close to what I like, wouldn't I take one up and do it? 

Universities could require a number of problems to be solved as coursework (e.g. a projects with the tag 'low energy building'). Students could then look for problems and ask for the approval of the instructors. (Or instructors could give a list of approved projects) they would then collaborate to find a solution.

Let's say an NGO in india needs a design for a hut that can be cheaply built, is comfortable for the dwellers, doesn't consume much energy and can be built with local materials and expertises. I would love to work on that as part of my coursework.. And I am sure kelly would accept that as a project instead of me working on a massive reconstruciton of the JW building. And maybe a guy in architecture could come in on this too. Maybe some from a mech eng course and maybe a structural engineer? Could the solution we come up with work? maybe. The maybe not. But when you allow anyone from any university or company to work on those problems, then maybe one group is bound to have a good solution.

If everythign everyone has done before is published copyright free (see if quality of Solar Decathlon projects has increased or decreased over the years. If it has decreased, this might be a flaw), solutions could be improved over the years.

Solutions would be ranked by class instructors  (kelly) and if he/she deemed it a valuable one, then she/he could submit it to the original asker, that could then use it for free. Students that put the effort into a project and produced a sound result, would get a reward. This would be represented by a badge endorsed by the asker (EWB, NGOs, ARUPâ€¦) or just a badge by the uni if let's say guys from the polithecnic of stokholm produced a better solution. This badge would go on their online CV. Employers could easily search these CVs, look for creative and passionate people that have solved problems (or scored well) similar to the ones they are needing to solve (tags). This could be a great incentive in doing well. The continuos availability of problems, on the other hand, would mean that while a good solution is rewarded, no train is missed by the students who didn't do as well.

Wouldnt't this be a better or at least complementary way to educate? or is the recollection of theory and techniques more important than their implementation?

A last word on the online community. It seems to me that people around the world are willing to give free time to do what they love. Why can't we harness that passion and use it to solve things that may be half a world away? AN online platform could connect people from different disciplines to problems that require multiple skills (tags).

I want to believe in this and all the good that could come out of it. Not much would be needed:
- project editing interface
- collaborative docs
- collaborative CAD
- collaborative mindmaps
- collaborative task management 

Almost all of these tools are already independently available.

It is only a question of wheather I am deluded and this is just a dream, or if it could really be.
