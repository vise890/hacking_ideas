	# About OpenEdu
	
	1. Problems in the real world have to be tackled daily by individuals, companies, NGOs, local and national governmentsâ€¦ It seems to me that, if they can routinely employ students as interns, there might be a lot of work that students could carry out.
	
	2. The project authors (Companies, NGOs, g'ments etc.) could take problems and transform them into project briefs of varying levels of difficulty. A project may be "make me a website to sell candies" or "should I install a PV panel on my warehouse, what are the costs and what system should I choose?". 
	Engineering, IT, and technical questions seem to me to be the best suited for this kind of approach. However, there may be some scope for graphic design, product design, architectural design, market research and others. 
	
	3. The projects are uploaded on a web 2.0 website. Each project has a description (project brief) and all the information to get started.
	Projects can be then tweaked and improved. For example, the project "Design a small, low energy hut that can be cheaply built with local materials and expertees in Indian slums of the state of Kerala", could be used over and over again. Students could use and improve previous solutions.
	
	4. The projects are assigned to online courses. A value for each project is established and a (fuzzy?) deadline is set. The projects can be used by universities around the world and online universities like Coursera.
	Some projects, however, could be standalone classess with requirements. For example, an IT system that needs some database functionality may require students to have taken a database management course before.
	
	5. Projects are assigned as homework to students of a relevenat course. The miryad of projects would ensure that students can choose between a wide spectrum and collaborate on something they feel passionate about.
	
	6. Students collaborate on projects in groups or do them as individuals. Students with different expertees could be conncted to work on a solution from different perspectives. In the Kerala example above, one could conect an architect, a civil engineer and a mechanical engineer.
	
	7. Students come up with solutions and upload them. Everything that is produced would be shared with the world under the CC license.
	
	8. Since the number of solutions could be potentially very high, the project authors would have a lot to choose from. They would select the best 10 solutions. The web community (or the student body taking that course or the teachers of that course) could help in doing a preliminary selection.
	
	9. The students with the best solution would be awarded a badge, endorsed by the project author. This would go on their online resume of achievements. The remaining top 9 student groups would also receive badges. These, apart from forming a very specific online resume that can be searched by employers for relevant projects, would also serve as incentive for the students to do well. Doing well would not just result in a good grade, but also in direct recognition from the industry.
