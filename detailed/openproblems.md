# OpenProblems

OpenProblems is a concept aimed at enabling whoever has the passion and the
expertise to solve real problems.

Problems are simply questions and needs that humans face around the globe. NGOs
such as EWB find such questions and needs and generate a network of people that
are passionate about the issue, are willing to work for free and have the
technical preparation to find creative sulutions. Other organisations such as
RedR do a similar thing.

If an online based communities are able to provide free support in practical
applications, then I ask myself, why couldn't this approach work in other areas
too? Could an implementation of the same methodology work for different
disciplines? A few that come to mind are advertisement, IT systems, product and
building design, mechanical engineering â€¦ Could there even be some potential
for other, more abstract disciplines such as philosophy or political science?
(e.g. solving or exploring current moral and political issues that a society
faces)

This would be very simimlar to the current practice of crowdsourcing, but
having an easily accessible platform that anyone can use
