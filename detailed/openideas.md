# About OpenIdeas

OpenIdeas is an experiment born from a simple concept:
	
* Not anyone can have a great idea, but a great one can come from anywhere.

I want to give it a shot, and see if it can be true.

My dream is to find a way to democratise new ideas in the 21st century. I would love to see a place where new concepts are born equal and where great ones are given a [fair chance][] to grow into products and services that are useful to the Human species.

If you think that something like that could be done, please consider [donating an idea][], spreading this message or [endorsing the project][]
