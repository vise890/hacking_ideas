The way we learn as university students has radically changed in the past few years. Technology should impose virtually no barrier into bringing the highest quality education to everyone in the world.

For the first time since the beginning of history of education, _the best teachers_ from the best schools (and why not form less known schools) can reach an audience of literally _billions._ Through the internet it should be easy to disseminate:

- Video lectures

- Course material (like OCW from MIT). However I think this needs a more open and liberal approach. The community should not only be able to view the content but I believe lecture material and notes should be open for editing to the world (wiki). Only then, through a process of continuous refinement, these materials could become really great. Now they are affected by several problems, among them incompleteness, copyright issues and others. 

This is not the death of universities as we know them. It simply is the beginning of an era in which information is truly free and virtually everyone is democratically entitled to have their chance.
