# Data for the rest of us

_**Data for the rest of us**_

I am mad as balls and I see the need to bring data and scientific evidence to the people to give them the power to make autonomous and sound decisions. There is so much out there, and something needs to make it accessible for the benefit of the community. I discussed how the concept came to my mind in a separate entry.

There is so much out there, it’s just that it is just not really useful for the regular person (check out TEDmed link below for some more insight about this phenomenon). Similarly to medical data, in a broader sense, scientific data is unaccessible. This prevents us from making the most out of it and implement practical solutions to tackle the problem at hand.

_**Need to bridge some gaps/fix fallacies in knowledge:**_

  * **Automatic negative associations/misunderstandings/preconceptions:** this seems very accentuated in the public. Something with relatively small (manegeable) impacts like Nuclear has a much bigger impact than other technologies because it is not well understood/not understood at all/inherently associated with other negative things (e.g. disasters such as Chernobyl, Fukushima). The fact is, nuclear has a much lower deaths/TWh than other ‘clean’ techs such as biomass. It is even safer than wind... ([http://bit.ly/g5Lo6D][1]). Interesting that even Chernobyl is much more well known than other disasters of equal, or even grater, proportions such as the Bhopal disaster [[http://bit.ly/9dqE8Z][2]]. In Bhopal 3,700 died immediately (50 immediate deaths in Chernobyl) and the land has been contaminated ever since. People live on the contaminated land and kids use the factory grounds as a football field but .. it’s India so no one really gives a fuck.
  * **Sense of scale:** public lacks sense of scale. If 248 people die in a plane crash (like in the Tenerife disaster, the worst plane crash _ever_, [http://bit.ly/16K5K0][3]), it’s huge news and people are terrified of flying forever. It is a tragedy, no doubt. But what is this compared to the 14000 deaths due to car accidents _every year in the US alone_?

  * _**How Should we do it?? ... Ideas for a website**_

  * Wiki based, community driven approach. Some part of the community should screen papers and provide data in a tabular/graphical form to make it more understandable. Maybe provide explanations. Then volunteers with graphic design abilities should take this data and transform it in visually appealing, easily understandable charts/graphs/diagrams. Final diagrams should be rechecked by initial community to ensure that data has not been misinterpreted.
  * Need to bring stats to the masses

_**More food for thought/inspiration:**_

  * Information is beautiful: strives to make information aesthetically pleasing. Wide ass focus, one guy. More trivia oriented than anything. [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/][4][http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Miscellaneum-Colorful-Worlds-Consequential/dp/0061748366][5]
  * TED Talk: Thomas Goetz: It's time to redesign medical data. Advocates the implementation of more aesthetically pleasing and most importantly the use of graphic design to make medical data more understandable and therefore more useful to the patient [http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_goetz_it_s_time_to_redesign_medical_data.html][6]
  * Hans Rosling [http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html][7] and pretty much everything else by him
  * Edward Tufte[http://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1300648641&sr=8-2][8]
