HTML 5 and caching on 20$ laptops. Workers can go in the field with no wifi connectivity and gather the data. A server with a wifi card can then be used in the office to run a db and gather and merge all the data as the workers come back from the field.

### Professional Experience – Gathering Data on informal settlements in India

One of the major hindrances to urban development in India today is the lack of comprehensive, detailed and up to date information about the myriad of informal settlements that exist across the country. To address the problem, the central government is starting to fund and encourage local administrations and NGOs to gather demographic and life-quality data for these settlements.

This summer I worked for EWB in a small NGO based in Pune, Maharashtra. The organisation aims to collect and analyse demographic, financial and healthcare data for each slum household in a number of cities in Maharashtra. This data is then connected to satellite imagery through GIS software so that spatial querying can be performed. Basing on this analysis, developments plans are prioritised for the settlements that are deemed as the most critical. The demographic data helps in determining the scale of the new development plans.

The collection of the data is carried out by a few social workers with multiple pages paper forms. It is very hard, however, to unify the particular set of data that is collected. Some questions relating to garbage collection or cooking stoves employing wood as fuel, for example, might be completely irrelevant in certain areas where the government already handles trash disposal or where all the households use kerosene stoves. In other areas, these questions might be very important indeed. In other words, the forms required to gather this data vary considerably from city to city and sometimes even from slum to slum. The downside is that, often, in the middle of a survey, the paper forms need to be updated and therefore reprinted, rebound and redistributed to the workers. This is not only a very time consuming process, but also wastes a considerable amount of paper, considering that workers might survey up to 300-400 households in a city with 70-80 slums with a 2 page form.

Once the data has been collected by the workers, these forms are brought into the various NGO offices, where the data is entered in a database so that GIS analysis can be performed and so that the data can be displayed graphically on the website for use by the local government and the general public.

This process is very linear since it does not improve when a new city is surveyed. The redaction of new forms is a simple matter of trial and error in each case and this wastes countless work hours, energy and paper. 

The work that I carried out this summer consisted in programming a new data entry interface and migrating to a new and more flexible database that can be expanded as needed by the workers. The software I wrote will be published on an online server in approximately one year after it is beta tested locally in one of the offices. This will not only allow for data to be inserted from virtually any office in the state and to be automatically pushed into the display website as soon as it is entered but hopefully even eliminate the need for workers entering data in the offices altogether.

My vision is that as India pushes for new wireless connectivity technologies (3G[[1]][1]) and extremely low cost portable devices ($20 laptop[[2]][2]), such devices could be employed by the social workers to input the data straight into the database while they are on the field using the new online data entry. The software (and its display website) can be adapted dynamically to allow for new questions to be added and for old ones to be removed on a per city basis. Again, all of this could be done in the field when there is need for it.

Eventually, as the process starts to flow more freely and as new changes and improvements are easily tested and implemented, a set of standard questions could be drafted and brought forward to a national level.

If the GIS maps are pushed to the cloud too, there would be even more room for improvement. In this case, the social workers could just click on a structure outline on a satellite image displayed on their portable device and attach the data they are collecting to the GIS maps on the go. Spatial querying could then be performed dynamically through the website (GeoMajas[[3]][3]). There would then be no need for workers at the office to attach the data to the maps.

Another improvement could be done by drawing the GIS maps with user edited contributed GPS traces. Online communities have shown an astonishing capability to produce online maps in incredibly short amounts of time[[4]][4].  If this is implemented the NGO would not have to buy these plans from 3rd parties any more and therefore reduce costs.

All these changes could effectively eliminate the need for all the computers running now in the various offices across the state and replacing them with low power consuming and cheap mobile devices while putting most of the raw processing load on cloud servers that are renowned for their efficiency in this field.
