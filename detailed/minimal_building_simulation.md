# Minimal Building Simulation Approach

Exploring a minimal approach to building simulation

# Notes

Can ESP-r be run as a server.
If i store everything server-side, can i just simulate 1 zone at a time. Have .cfg as a bonsai?

Set up csh+ ruby scripts
	- default control loops 
	- default weather and location
	- default construction db (decluttered)
	- default IPV and results analysis

.cfg goes in, IPV comes back. Everything else runs on the server
