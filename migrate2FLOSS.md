# Migrate to FLOSS

Move all the things to FLOSS, improve, build, but don't lose conveniences.

## GNU/Linux Shortcomings / annoyances

### Shortcuts
- they're still kind of lame compared to their mac os equivalent;
- especially the text movement (cmd/alt/shift)
  - alt is not used? use ctrl?
- apple-D to save on desktop when saving

### Terminal
- gnome-terminal is inferior to iTerm
  - doesn't remember directory
    - new tab in same dir IDK
  - switching tabs is kind of a pain in the ass
  - new window/tab is crap (mitigate with gnome-terminal custom shortcuts)
  - use tmux?
- TERMINAL COLORS. OMG how hard is this

### File Browsing
- column view `U_U`
- shortcuts (new folder, back, fwd, delete, empty trash)
- QuickLook

### Missing apps
- alfred (make one.../hack)
  - search through dev docs (dash)
  - search through files
  - view contacts
  - dictionary definitions / thesaurus
  - previews (a la Yosemite spotlight)

- dash (make one../hack http://zealdocs.org/)

- spectactle (openbox/i3 + gnome?)

- f.lux

- iterm2

- dictionary

- contacts

- password management (1password or similar)
  - hack on mitro
  - pass?

### Android Apps
- Email app (sparrow)
  - gmail is fine. BUT it *only* works with gmail
- Reminder app (due for iOS)

# Proprietary stuff I still depend on
- Gmail (mailpile??)
- GMaps (OSM with nicer CSS?)
- Gcontacts (flock?)
- Gdrive (gdocs, etc) (only needed for work. I'm fine with md)
- GHangouts / Skype (Tox?)
- Gcal + iCal (flock? + california + web???)
- Gsync (phone apps)
- Chrome
- Dropbox (syncthing?)
- Github (meh, gh is fine, Gitlab if needed)
- Dash
- Alfred
